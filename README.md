# Exporter-Edgecast

### What is this repository for?

This is a Prometheus Exporter/Collector for Edgecast CDN.

Exporter-Edgecast uses the [edgecast-client](https://github.com/mre/edgecast) created by [Matthias Endler](https://github.com/mre) to fetch metrics from the EdgeCast CDN API and then transforms and exposes them to be scraped and displayed by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).

### Package Management
* This project uses **dep** as package manager
* versions are tracked in `Gopkg.lock`
* glide settings are included in `Gopkg.toml`
* get dep here: [https://github.com/golang/dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)

### Static Analysis
- ```make lint``` (uses gometalinter, downloads and installs it in case of absence)

### Build
- ```make build``` (builds for Windows or Unix, after checking ```$(OS),Windows_NT```)

### Configure
- You need to set two environment-variables to configure your Edgecast-Account:
    + EDGECAST_ACCOUNT_ID
    + EDGECAST_TOKEN
- e.g. on Linux: `export EDGECAST_TOKEN=B12AC`
- Optionally, you can also configure the queried platforms (see below for
  possible values), e.g.:
    + EDGECAST_PLATFORMS=3,8

### Run
- `./bin/main` (Unix) or `.\bin\main.exe` (Windows)
- via Docker:
    + build Docker image: `make docker`
    + run Docker image: `(sudo) docker run -p=<some_free_port>:80 trivago/monitoring:edgecast-v1 -e "EDGECAST_TOKEN=<your_token>" -e "EDGECAST_ACCOUNTID=<your_id>"`
        * NOTE: <some_free_port> must be the same as specified in the job-description in prometheus.yml


### View Exposed Metrics:
- via Browser on the same machine: visit [http://localhost:80/metrics](http://localhost:80/metrics)
    + via Browser on different machine: change "localhost" to endpoint address
- via existing Prometheus server installation: 
    + start new server locally using the provided configuration file:
        * `prometheus -config-file=prometheus.yml`
        * view results here: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
    + copy & paste job from provided `prometheus.yml` to running server's configuration to scrape the service metrics
